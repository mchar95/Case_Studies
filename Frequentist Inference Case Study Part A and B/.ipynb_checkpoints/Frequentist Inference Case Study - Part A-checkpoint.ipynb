    "Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: \n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval"

      "    deviations from the mean, i.e., ``std = sqrt(mean(x))``, where\n",
      "    ``x = abs(a - a.mean())**2``.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The average squared deviation is typically calculated as ``x.sum() / N``,\n",
      "    where ``N = len(x)``. If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor\n",
      "    ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1``\n",
      "    provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of the infinite population.\n",
      "    ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for\n",
      "    normally distributed variables. The standard deviation computed in this\n",
      "    function is the square root of the estimated variance, so even with\n",
      "    ``ddof=1``, it will not be an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation\n",
      "    per se.\n",

      "    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute\n",

You've calculated the average (the mean) of this sample and seen that this is not exactly equal to the expected population parameter (which we know because we're generating the random variates from a specific, known distribution). You've been introduced to two ways of calculating the standard deviation; one uses $n$ in the denominator and the other uses $n-1$ (Bessel's correction). You've also seen which of these calculations np.std() performs by default and how to get it to generate the other."

    "So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. **The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases (the intuitions behind the CLT are covered in full on p. 236 of *AoS*). For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n",

This brings us to a fundamental question: _when we make some inference about a population based on our sample, how confident can we be that we've got it 'right'?_\n",
